to as root facts.</p>

<h2>22 June. 2010</h2>
<p>Finished off the core components of the alternative Aspects implementation.
This implementation is intended to be lighter weight and better suited to 
manipulation in more traditional database structures rather than only in
XML databases.</p>

<p>Added new methods to retrieve Calendar objects for start and end
dates and instants, all adjusted for XBRL 2.1 specification features.</p>

<h2>3 May. 2010</h2>
<p>Made the org.xbrlapi.Measure Comparable so that unit numerator
and denominator measures could have a natural ordering.</p>

<p>Made the entity identification scheme a real URI rather than a
string.</p>


<h2>21 Apr. 2010</h2>
<p>Added new method to the Store interface to count XML resources
with a given type.</p>
<p>Added a getAllFacts method to the data store to allow retrieval
of all facts (root level and those that are children of tuples).</p>

<h2>15 Apr. 2010</h2>
<p>Simplified the handling of serialization.</p>

<h2>15 Mar. 2010</h2>
<p>Added source fragment URI and target fragment URI data to
relationship XML resources.</p>
<p>Modified the Linkbase#getExtendedLinks method to return the empty
list rather than null if the linkbase contains no extended links.</p>

<h2>11 Mar. 2010</h2>
<p>Added new convenience methods to get sets of fragment indices
from the data store.</p>

<h2>2 Mar. 2010</h2>
<p>Added a getConceptCount method to the org.xbrlapi.Schema
interface.</p>
<p>Added the getImporters method to the .xbrlapi.Schema interface.</p>

<h2>25 Feb. 2010</h2>
<p>The org.xbrlapi.Fragment#getLanguage() method now works for any
node in a fragment and it handles language code inheritance through the
XML heirarchy.</p>

<h2>7 Dec. 2009</h2>
<p>Added a new history tracking system for loaders so that it is
possible to reload the documents in a data store while preserving the
document identifiers used in the initial loading process.</p>

<h2>27 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug in the linkbase fragment implementation that
prevented retrieval of the child extended links in the linkbase.</p>

<h2>25 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Aligned constant URI syntax in XDT module with the URI syntax for
constants in the utilities module.</p>

<h2>24 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed a problem with determining if a location aspect value has a
parent location aspect value when the location aspect value is for a
fact that is contained within a tuple.</p>
<p>Changed getAxisAspects method on the AspectModel interface to
always return a list. The list is empty if the axis has no aspects in
the aspect model.</p>

<h2>23 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Changed label retrieval methods for aspects to make them uniform
across all aspect implementations. Added new linkbase methods to analyse
the extended links contained in them.</p>

<h2>10 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Made aspects record facts with missing aspect values rather than
ignoring them.</p>


<h2>9 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Improved the handling of the dimension aspect labelling to
exploit XBRL labels for such dimensions.</p>

<h2>5 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Added aspect label method so that labels can be provided that
identify aspects.</p>
<p>Changed the getMatches method of the org.xbrlapi.aspects.Aspect
interface to throw an exception if the aspect does not have an aspect
value as the matching criterion.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug in the DimensionalAspectModel that prevented facts
from having their dimensional aspect values recorded properly as new
dimensional aspect values were discovered.</p>

<h2>3 Nov. 2009</h2>
<p>Made the org.xbrlapi.Concept#getPeriodType method return null for
tuple concepts instead of throwing an exception.</p>
<p>Prevented the org.xbrlapi.Concept#isNumeric from tripping up on
Tuple concepts.</p>

<h2>30 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Added means of getting fragments linking to a specified URI to
the store interface.</p>

<h2>29 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Added the ability to test if concepts and type declarations are
XBRL numeric item data types.</p>
<p>Added a method to the aspect model interface to enable retrieval
of all aspect values (one per aspect in the model) for a given fact.</p>

<h2>27 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Added convenience methods to the org.xbrlapi.Fragment interface
to support better analysis of fragment hierarchies within XML documents
as opposed to XLink relationship networks.</p>
<p>Added new methods to the org.xbrlapi.aspects.AspectValue
interface to support more sophisticated handling of hierarchies of
values for a given aspect.</p>

<h2>26 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Standardised handling of missing aspect values. This became a big
deal once tuples were allowed within aspect models and the location
aspect was introduced. Added a new getLabels method for fragments to
make it easier to have graceful fall back if first preferences for
languages and label role are not able to be fulfilled.</p>

<h2>22 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Tuples are now treated as facts in aspect models.</p>
<p>Fixed a glitch in the tuple/fractionItem identification logic to
prevent tuples within tuples from causing their parent tuples to be
identified as fraction items.</p>

<h2>21 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Changed method names for the org.xbrlapi.aspects.AspectModel
interface to replace the word dimension with the more consistently used
word Axis.</p>

<h2>20 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Sorted out tuple identification and fraction item identification
so that it works always. Also made fraction item methods robust to all
kinds of perverse fraction items that restrict the fraction item type
and rename the numerator and denominator elements in fraction items.</p>
<p>Enhanced location aspect handling in aspect models and simplified
aspect value validation logic by adding a new version of the
org.xbrlapi.XML#isa() method to take a class as an argument rather than
a class name.</p>

<h2>19 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug in tuple detection.</p>

<h2>8 Oct. 2009</h2>
<p>Added method to the org.xbrlapi.cache.Cache interface to allow
retrieval of a list of the URIs contained in a the cache directory
corresponding to a given URI or in any of that directory's descendant
directories. This can be a quick way to reload data into a data store.
It is also useful if you want to unzip a set of taxonomy files directly
into the cache, effectively faking their publication on the internet,
and then loading the files that you have added directly to the cache.</p>

<h2>25 Sep. 2009</h2>
<p>Created a new Oracle Berkeley XML Database store constructor that
gives users control over the cache size of the database.</p>

<h2>18 Sep. 2009</h2>
<p>Made the getReferencingItems method of the
org.xbrlapi.FactDimensionContainer interface generic so that you can
specify if the items are numeric (helpful for units for example).</p>

<p>Added new methods to the org.xbrlapi.Schema interface to support
retrieval of all global complex and simple type declarations and to
support retrieval of any named global declaration.</p>

<p>Added new methods to the org.xbrlapi.TypeDeclaration interface to
support finality analysis and to support analysis of type derivation
paths.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in handling of QNames with no namespace prefixes when
looking up QName namespaces via the org.xbrlapi.Fragment interface.</p>

<h2>14 Sep. 2009</h2>
<p>Modified the cache loading utility example to load a part of a
cache rather than the whole cache. This provides a nice way of testing
before publication of a taxonomy by copying it to a place in the
taxonomy cache and then loading from there rather than from the
prospective publication location.</p>
<p>Modified the org.xbrlapi.Instance interface to provide a range of
new methods that reduce the computational burden involved in summarising
the information contained in an XBRL business report.</p>

<h2>10 Sep. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new getTuples method to the org.xbrlapi.Instance interface
to enable retrieval of all tuples that are children of the root element
of the XBRL instance.</p>

<h2>9 Sep. 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug, identified by Karel Arkema, in the
org.xbrlapi.data.BaseStoreImpl#getTuplesFromInstances(List) method. This
now ensures that tuples are correctly identified.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug in the relationship persistence behaviour of the
Loader discover method that prevents analysis of relationships where the
related fragments have not all been discovered yet.</p>
<p>Made the Transformer classes within Aspects public so that they
can be accessed and customised.</p>
<p>Created a new utility example that loads all of the documents in
a specified taxonomy cache location.</p>

<h2>7 Sep. 2009</h2>

<p>Added methods to the org.xbrlapi.Fragment interface that enable
access to the XPointer expressions that could be used to reference the
root element of the fragment.</p>

<p>Changed the method signatures for the Resource methods that
retrieve the name of the language used for an extended link resource.</p>

<h2>25 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Started work on fleshing out an enhanced XML Schema fragmentation
system to allow deeper analysis of XML schema content model
declarations.</p>

<h2>21 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug in simple link traversal to ensure that matching URIs
are taken care of behind the scenes. Previously a simple link to a
duplicate document would show up as being broken, implying that the DTS
has not been fully discovered.</p>

<h2>20 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Made the org.xbrlapi.SimpleLink#getTargetDocumentURI() method
public.</p>

<h2>18 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new methods to the org.xbrlapi.networks.Networks interface
to enable all relationships from or to a given fragment to be obtained
for all networks in the set of networks.</p>

<h2>13 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new transient part of store state to keep track of the set
of loaders that are currently loading data into the store. This enables
loaders in different threads to co-ordinate their relationship
persistence activities. Added new getSourceIndices method to the Store
interface. Added methods to facilitate more efficient handling of
concept analysis in terms of the facts for that concept.</p>

<h2>11 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new method to access a map of language names from a data
store. Changed the getLanguage method to getEncoding for Language
fragments. Added a new class to facilitate rapid analysis of language
encodings and names.</p>

<h2>7 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new org.xbrlapi.impl.LanguageComparator method that
compares Language fragments based on their codes and then the language
names.</p>

<h2>4 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new method:
org.xbrlapi.data.Store#getRootFragments(String). This provides access to
document root fragments of a given type. It is useful for retrieving all
schema root elements or all XBRL instance root elements.</p>

<h2>3 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Made the arcrole and linkrole parameter orderings for methods
consistent for the networks and the data packages. Extended network
related unit tests to check consistency. Added a new utility example
that enables investigation of relationship properties for a specified
document fragment in the data store.</p>

<h2>1 Aug. 2009</h2>
<p>Refined the org.xbrlapi.data.Store#getConcept method to use a
single XQuery. This should improve performance. Fixed a bug in the
retrieval of the data root element for fragments being built. The code
used to just return the container element for the data root element for
such fragments. Modified the handling of xml:lang attributes for XLink
resources, copying inherited values onto the resource element itself.
This makes for much faster querying and fixes a bug in the handling of
the xml:lang attributes where previously inherited attributes were not
being detected.</p>

<h2>31 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>Modified the org.xbrlapi.Measures interface to capture the
measure QName prefix as a measure property. This changes the
implementation constructor. Added an additional example utility showing
how to analyse units of measurement in an XBRL instance. Added new unit
test for Oracle Berkeley XML database handling of multiple namespace
prefix declarations for the one namespace. Fixed a problem in capturing
namespace prefix declarations when the prefix is not used for an
attribute or element and where the namespace being given the prefix is
being used for an attribute or element.</p>

<h2>28 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>Moved the DBConnection implementation to be an inner class of the
eXist store implementation. Cleaned up the eXist store deletion method.
</p>

<h2>27 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>Eliminated the org.xbrlapi.networks.Relationship interface and
implementation, replacing it throughout with the very similar but more
complete org.xbrlapi.PersistedRelationship interface and implementation.
Created additional org.xbrlapi.networks.Analyser implementations to
filter relationships in various ways (all relationships or all
relationships that are not marked as being prohibited on the arc
declaring them). These alter the results relating to network methods for
data stores that use persisted relationships.</p>

<h2>21 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>Made most classes serializable. Introduced axes in place of
dimensions in aspect models to avoid clashes with XDT dimensions. This
causes backward incompatibility of the API but eliminates bugs in the
dimension aspect implementations.</p>

<h2>16 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>Added arc URI to the information persisted for each relationship.
Added in persisted error information capture using the data store to
track problems as they arise during persistence of relationships. Added
Freemarker to the list of dependencies in the examples Maven POM file.</p>

<h2>14 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>Simplified the org.xbrlapi.utilities.Constants class to use
java.net.URI rather than strings for all URI constants. Refined the
treatment of type="none" XLink attributes to ensure that such elements
were not treated as XLink elements.</p>

<h2>8 Jul. 2009</h2>
<p>The examples have been repackaged, debugged, and extended to
include a number of new data store maintenance utilities.</p>

<h2>30 Jun. 2009</h2>
<p>Finalised a broad range of modifications to the relationship
persistence code; document matching performance improvements; 0 and the
XPath 2.0 to XQuery 1.0 query language change.</p>

<h2>18 Mar. 2009</h2>
<p>Enabled the loader to augment persisted relationships upon
successful completion of a document discovery process if the resulting
data store contains a complete DTS (so that all relationship networks
can be analysed without running into missing fragments). Finalised the
persisted relationship rendering example.</p>

<h2>11 Mar. 2009</h2>
<p>Changed the methods retrieving active relationships from a
network for a given source or target fragment to return a sorted set of
relationships, sorted by order rather than a standard list of
relationships. Eliminated the FragmentList interface and implementation.
This is now done with standard Java collections.</p>

<h2>10 Mar. 2009</h2>
<p>Changed the getOrder method of the Arc fragment interface to
return a Double rather than a String.</p>

<h2>26 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Eliminated the XBRLStore interface and implementation, merging
the functionality back into the base store interface and implementation.
This is a precursor to refactoring all network analysis code into the
data store implementations and out of the fragment implementations so
that data store specific optimisations are easier to exploit. Added a
new method for Networks to allow two Network collections to be merged.
Added more methods to get references for fragments. Removed remaining
fragment data modification methods. Eliminated network analysis methods
from the fragment interface, pushing responsibility for such operations
to the store so that the store can optimise network analysis in various
ways.</p>

<h2>24 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Completed a first cut of a network analyser that enables
interaction and analysis of persisted networks of relationships. A lot
of methods are available to facilitate easy interaction with labels and
references.</p>

<h2>20 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Modified Store to provide a wider range of query options and to
make query processing more efficient. Added a new store query method
that returns the number of results generated rather than the actual
results. Adjusted string and indices queries to work with sets rather
than lists for efficiency purposes. Adjusted the getArcroles and
getLinkroles methods of the XBRLStore to work with sets rather than
lists for efficiency purposes.</p>

<h2>19 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Changed the store method names in the org.xbrlapi.data.Store
interface. Continued modifying method signatures to use URI instead of
String whereever p<a class="title"
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">Free
Open-Source Software</a>ible. Completed a first cut of the Storer interface
and implementation for persisting active network relationships in the
data store. This should facilitate more efficient network analysis in
some circumstances by enabling the cost of network analysis to be
handled in a once off operation prior to the interactive analysis of the
data.</p>

<h2>18 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Additional changes to method signatures to pass URIs where p<a
		class="title"
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">Free
Open-Source Software</a>ible instead of strings. Corrected bugs in the
UsedOn fragment subclass to ensure that inherited methods are not
overridden in manners that contradict their intent.</p>

<h2>17 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Refactored fragment interfaces to distinguish document fragments
from other kinds of XML resources in the data store. This is needed to
retain clarity now that a broader range of information about
relationships is stored directly in the data store.</p>

<h2>12 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Made the loader process able to handle all kinds of exceptions
during the parsing process without causing the document discovery
process to be derailed or the document cache or data store to be
corrupted. Improved the efficiency of the document queue for data
loading to improve the performance when loading very large numbers of
documents.</p>

<h2>11 Feb. 2009</h2>
<p>Added new queryForString and queryForStrings methods to the
org.xbrlapi.data.Store interface and all implementations thereof.
Modified the in-store URI matching to ensure that a signature only needs
to be computed once for each document in the data store.</p>

<h2>28 Jan. 2009</h2>
<p>Modified additional function signatures to work with URI
arguments rather than string representations of URI arguments. Added
loader focussed unit testing for loading of duplicate resources.</p>

<h2>26 Jan. 2009</h2>
<p>Changed the loader's document queue to be a map from URIs to load
status rather than from String representations of URIs to load status to
enable better analysis of URI equality. Modified the data store to keep
track of reasons for documents not being loaded when storing the loader
state. This enables robust handling of situations where documents that
should be in the DTS are have IO problems or have SAX parsing problems.
</p>

<h2>1 Jan. 2009</h2>
<p>Created the local test data file release.</p>

<h2>31. Dec. 2008</h2>
<p>Replaced usage of URLs with URIs throughout the API. This was
done to get better uniformity of handling of URLs and to take advantage
of the better handling of different schemes in the java.net.URI
interface compared to the java.net.URL interface. This change does cause
significant backward compatibility issues. However, it is expected to
resolve the ongoing problems that have been encountered when working
with file-scheme URLs. Improved the network processing efficiency of the
rendering example. Incorporated improvements to the Freemarker template
file from Walter Hamscher.</p>

<h2>10 Dec. 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed the NPE bug in the handling of processing instructions that
come before any markup in an XML document. Fixed missing class files in
the examples JAR.</p>

<h2>9 Dec. 2008</h2>
<p>Added in XDT aspects and dimensional aspect model to the XDT
module.</p>

<h2>5 Dec. 2008</h2>
<p>Changed the getAttribute methods of the Arc fragment interface to
return null if the arc does not have the specified attribute rather than
throwing an exception.</p>

<h2>4 Dec. 2008</h2>
<p>Added new methods to better handle analysis of presentation
networks and to provide a more complete range of network construction
methods. Added the new org.xbrlapi.networks.Network#complete method to
allow for a network to be completely constructed in a single call.</p>

<h2>24 Nov. 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed NPE in the method to get denominator measures for an
org.xbrlapi.Unit that does not have a denominator. Created the first XDT
file release.</p>

<h2>22. Nov. 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed up the usage of the isNil method to use nil rather than
nill and to be for facts rather than just items. Added a measure
interface and implementation to handle measures in unit fragments. This
makes it easier to access resolved measure QNames in numerators and
denominators. This also causes backward incompatibility issues for some
methods of the org.xbrlapi.Unit interface.</p>

<h2>21 Nov. 2008</h2>
<p>Made the getNetworkRoots method of the XBRLStore a generic method
and ensured that it does not return locators.</p>

<h2>20 Nov. 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed a bug in the Fragment implementation relating to getting
the local name from a QName. QNames without a prefix were not handled
correctly. Squeezed more performance out of the method to get the labels
for a fragment. Some new constants have been defined.</p>

<h2>19 Nov. 2008</h2>
<p>Added a new org.xbrlapi.aspects package to handle Aspect model
population with facts. Aspect models can be loosely thought of as sparse
hypercubes. They are very very useful!</p>

<h2>14 Nov. 2008</h2>
<p>Created the first examples file release.</p>

<h2>19 Aug. 2008</h2>
<p>Enabled the getFragments method to use a fragment class name
rather than just part of the fragment interface name. This makes the
method more able to work for fragment classes that are implemented in
packages outside those in the core XBRLAPI fragment implementation
package.</p>

<h2>18 Aug. 2008</h2>
<p>Added methods to the base store implementation to enable a store
to limit query results to those fragments in the documents with a
specified set of URLs. Changed the query methods for the various store
implementations to filter query results if the store knows of a list of
URLs to use in filtering query results. Implemented new store methods to
determine the documents that directly reference and that are directly
referenced by a given document based on link analysis.</p>

<h2>7 Aug. 2008</h2>
<p>Changed the org.xbrlapiSAXHandlers package name to
org.xbrlapi.sax. This is not a backward compatible change and code using
the XBRLAPI may need to be adjusted.</p>

<h2>6 Aug. 2008</h2>
<p>Removed the element depth from the set of state information
tracked by the SAX content handler for the loader, the loader itself and
the XBRL XLink handler. This was done by relying instead on tracking the
ElementState during SAX parsing. Added Attributes to the parameters of
the XLink processor's endElement method. Added the ElementState class to
the org.xbrlapi.xlink package to provide basic infrastructure for
tracking attributes and making them available to the endElement method
in SAX content handlers that are using the XLink processor.</p>

<h2>30 Jul. 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed bug in queries to get network roots. Fixed bug in caching
on Windows. Removed non-functional set methods Released version 3.1
Eliminated several memory leaks in the Oracle Berkeley XML data store.</p>

<h2>April 16 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed up eXist unit testing to reflect changes in the XBRLAPI
itself. Added a range of new constants for the XBRL role and arcroles.</p>

<h2>10 Apr. 2008</h2>
<p>Added resource matcher facility.</p>

<h2>12 Mar. 2008</h2>
<p>Changed the fragment index generation system. This makes it
easier to work acr<a class="title"
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">Free
Open-Source Software</a> several data stores.</p>

<h2>25 Feb. 2008</h2>
<p>Discovery of documents provided as a string now works correctly.
QName lookups for fragments is faster and always works. Network
construction works for networks of various types of labels.</p>

<h2>25. Oct. 2007</h2>
<p>Fixed up a bug in Arc instantiation that was preventing them from
being stored in the database. The bug was introduced during the redesign
of the fragment constructors.</p>

<h2>24 Oct. 2007</h2>
<p>Added the getFacts method to the concept implementation. Added
the isNumeric method to the fact implementation.</p>

<h2>16 Oct. 2007</h2>
<p>Modified the fragment factory to call the setFragmentIndex method
when generating new fragments. October 16, 2006 Streamlined the DTS
discovery process to eliminate all post processing of XLink materials.
Enabled eXist data store to also operate in embedded mode, significantly
enhancing performance.</p>

<h2>17 Sep. 2007</h2>
<p>Modified fragment implementations to make all fragments
JavaBeans. Serialization of fragments, builders, and stores is yet to be
implemented.</p>

<h2>5 Sep. 2007</h2>
<p>Eliminated non-working attempts to insert DTD declarations into
data store fragments. Added a new getDeclaration method for reference
part fragments. Fixed a bug in the removeFragment implementation for the
DOM data store whereby the removed fragments were not getting taken out
of the XML DOM structure, only the maps onto that DOM structure. Added
the deleteDocument and deleteRelated document methods to the store
interface. Provided implementations of these methods in the
BaseStoreImpl class. Created tests of the methods using the DOM data
store.</p>

<h2>4 Sep. 2007</h2>
<p>Added BDB XML indexing of the arcroleType and roleType URI
attributes. Added ability to recognise generic labels and references as
standard labels and references, respectively. Added the isProhibited
method to arcs.</p>

<h2>1 Sep. 2007</h2>
<p>Added a method to get linkroles that contain arcs using a
specified arcrole.</p>

<h2>15 Aug. 2007</h2>
<p>Added getSimpleLinks method to the fragment interface to get the
child simple links of any fragment. Checked unit tests against the
latest cut of the XBRL 2.1 conformance suite. Enabled caching for
documents provided to a loader as a string rather than a URL. This fixed
a bug in the XML Schema grammar construction for schemas provided as a
string to the loader. Fixed a database deletion problem in the Xindice
tests that arose because of multiple simultaneous stores using the same
database. Provided a new getChildFragments method of the data store to
enable retrieval of all child fragments with a given data type.</p>

<h2>14 Aug. 2007</h2>
<p>Enabled the discovery processes to optionally include analysis of
XSI schema location attributes. Added schema method to enable discovery
of extended links contained within the schema.</p>

<h2>11 Aug 2007</h2>
<p>Added new discoverNext method to the loader implementation to
enable intervention in the load process between each document that gets
parsed. Added unit tests of the discoverNext method using in-memory and
persistent data stores.</p>

<h2>9 August, 2007</h2>
<p>Added unit tests to cover discovery of reference part
declarations.</p>

<h2>8 Aug. 2007</h2>
<p>Fixed bug in the SimpleLink#getTargetFragment where href
attributes without an XPointer would generate a query that did not
restrict matching fragments to the document root. Extended the set of
nodes in a data store that are indexed for equality matching for the BDB
XML database implementation. Added getImports and getIncludes methods to
the Schema fragment API. Added unit tests to cover schema imports.</p>

<h2>July 29, 2007</h2>
<p>Added new objects to provide functionality at the level of
individual relationships and networks of relationships. Fixed up NPE bug
in the hasFragment method of the eXist data store.</p>

<h2>May 21, 2007</h2>
<p>Fixed up omission of class files from the JAR file.</p>

<h2>March 23, 2007</h2>
<p>Created the api module by splitting out the non-DOM data store
implementations and by splitting out the XLink, XMLBase and XPointer
packages.</p>

<h2>October 02, 2006</h2>
<p>Completed implementation and testing of read-access fragment API.
</p>

<h2>September 25, 2006</h2>
<p>Fixed up the Exist indexing. Added a lot of fragment interface
implementation. Merged the data and metadata collections. Fixed up the
Jar file manifest to make the -jar file option work from execution at
the commandline.</p>

<h2>September 14, 2006</h2>
<p>Added in the patch from Henry S Thompson to support XLink 1.1.
Improved usability from the command line. Extended the implementation of
the fragment.</p>

<h2>August 10, 2006</h2>
<p>Implemented the data store using eXist and using an XML-DOM
object. These are alternatives to the Xindice data store implementation.
</p>

<h2>July 29. 2006</h2>
<p>Created the Oracle Berkeley Database XML data store module.
Created the core utilities module that is required by all other modules.
</p>

<h2>March 23. 2006</h2>
<p>Created the eXist module by splitting it out from the xbrlapi.
This limits XBRLAPI dependencies on eXist to those users choosing to use
eXist as the data store implementation.</p>

<h2>December 11, 2005</h2>
<p>Version 1.0 of the XPointer processor released.</p>

<h2>December 9. 2005</h2>
<p>Fixed errors in the previous release. Updated the API to handle
XPointers. Added early support for the eXist database.</p>

<h2>July 23. 2005</h2>
<p>Initial cut of the XBRL API source code. Operational version of
the XML Base resolver.</p>

<h2>May 6, 2005</h2>
<p>Initial cut of XLink processor. Initial cut of XML Base resolver.
