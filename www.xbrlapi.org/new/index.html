<h1>
What is new for the XBRLAPI? 
</h1>

<h2>
  28 July 2009: Version 5.0 released.
</h2>

<p>
 Version 5.0 has been released. 
 The query language is now
XQuery 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.  This change has meant
that the Xindice data store is no longer supported.
The new release also provides mature relationship
persistence features, enabling XLink relationships
to be documented in the persisted database to 
dramatically improve the performance of operations
relying on the analysis of XLink relationship networks.
A number of significant changes have also been made to
function signatures in the API, reflecting the fact that
data stores now contain considerably more information
than just fragments of XBRL documents.
</p>

<h2>
  8 July 2009: Planning for new file release
</h2>

<p>
  A new file release is planned for July 31, 2009.
  This will be version 5.0 of the XBRLAPI.
  It is not going to be fully backward compatible.
</p>

<h2>
  8 July 2009: Data store query changes
</h2>

<p>
  XPath 1.0 has been replaced with XQuery 1.0 as the data store query language.
  To handle differences in data stores between how all of the document root elements
  can be identified, all queries are now preprocessed to replace occurrences of the 
  string '#roots#' with the data store specific expression needed to select the
  root elements of the full set of XML Resources in the data store.
</p>

<h2>
  8 July 2009: More examples
</h2>

<p>
  A new set of examples have been provided showing ways in which the XBRLAPI data 
  store can be maintained.  These are available in the 
  <a href="/javadoc/org/xbrlapi/data/bdbxml/examples/utilities/package-summary.html">org.xbrlapi.data.bdbxml.examples.utilities package</a>.
  They are documented by their Javadoc.
  Existing examples have been repackaged to reflect their data store dependencies.
  Examples have also be adapted to make them easier to unit test.
</p>

<h2>
  8 July 2009: Method signature changes
</h2>

<p>
  In preparation for the release of XBRLAPI 5.0, a number of API changes have been
  made.  These largely relate to a broadening of the kinds of data that can be stored 
  in the data store and to an increased level of consistency in using the java.net.URI 
  for URIs.
</p>

<h2>
  8 July 2009: Relationship persistence
</h2>

<p>
  In some situations the query cost involved in real-time XLink relationship analysis 
  can be problematic.  In those situations, XLink relationship analysis can be
  done in advance with relationship information being persisted to the data store.
  This relationship persistence enables substantial improvements in
  the performance of relationship network analysis.
  Usage of persisted relationships is also largely hidden from the end user.
