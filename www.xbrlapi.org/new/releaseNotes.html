<h2>Release 5.0</h2>
<p>July 28, 2009</p>
<p>

Backward incompatible release of the API involving fundamental
changes to the query language.  The query language is now
XQuery 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.  This change has meant
that the Xindice data store is no longer supported.
The new release also provides mature relationship
persistence features, enabling XLink relationships
to be documented in the persisted database to 
dramatically improve the performance of operations
relying on the analysis of XLink relationship networks.
A number of significant changes have also been made to
function signatures in the API, reflecting the fact that
data stores now contain considerably more information
than just fragments of XBRL documents.
</p>

<h2>Release 4.0</h2>
<p>January 7, 2009</p>
