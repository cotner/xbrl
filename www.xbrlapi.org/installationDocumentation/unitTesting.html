<h1>XBRLAPI Unit testing with JUnit</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A comprehensive test of your XBRLAPI installation is possible using the
<a href="http://www.junit.org/index.htm">JUnit</a> tests that are distributed 
with XBRLAPI.</p>

<h2>Install a local version of the XBRL 2.1 conformance suite</h2>

<p>If you want to run the unit tests that are distributed with XBRLAPI,
then it is necessary to configure the test data environment. A key part
of this configuration involves installation of the XBRL 2.1 conformance
suite.</p>

<p>The conformance suite is available as a <a href="http://www.xbrl.org/2007/XBRL-CONF-CR3-2007-03-05.zip">zip 
file</a> from the XBRL.ORG website.</p>

<p>Download the zip file and extract it to the desired location in your
local environment. You can either serve up the files in the conformance
suite directly from your local file system (using the file scheme URLs)
or you can serve them via a local web server such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> (using http scheme URLs).</p>

<h2>Set up the test configuration file</h2>

<p>It is necessary to set a range of test configuration properties to
provide information regarding the setup of the underlying data stores
and the available test data. This is done using a Java properties file
whose location must be specified by a system property called <code>xbrlapi.test.configuration</code>.</p>

<p>The test configuration file sets a large number of configuration
properties. These are explained in the <a href="testConfigurationFile.html">test configuration documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Among other possibilities, you can set this system property by adding
<code>-Dxbrlapi.test.configuration=/path/to/configuration/file/filename</code> to the set of 
parameters used when running Java.  In Eclipse,  add this as a virtual machine argument for
your project's java runtime environment. Naturally set the <code>/path/to/configuration/file</code> to a the
value of the path to the configuration file that you want to use and set <code>filename</code> to the name
of your configuration file.</p>

<p>
  You can grab a copy of a complete properties file from the 
  <a href="http://xbrlapi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xbrlapi/trunk/test.configuration.properties?view=log">SVN repository</a>.
</p>

<h2>Execute the Unit Tests</h2>

<p>Unit test execution can be done in a number of ways.  These include:<p>

<ul>
	<li>Unit testing from the command line</li>
	<li>Unit testing using the Eclipse IDE</li>
	<li>Unit testing using Maven</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit testing from the command line</h2>

<p>You can use one of the TestRunner classes provided by JUnit to 
do the unit tests from the command line.  For example, to use the text UI
test runner, for the full set of tests except those for persistent data stores,
you could use (presuming all the necessary classes are 
on the classpath):</p>

<p><code>java -Xmx1g -Dxbrlapi.test.configuration=[PATH.TO.CONFIGURATION.FILE] junit.textui.TestRunner org.xbrlapi.tests.AllTests</code></p>

<p>You would have to replace [PATH.TO.CONFIGURATION.FILE] with the full path to and the file name of 
the file containing the test configuration properties.</p>

<p>The -Xmx1g parameter is supplied to ensure that you do not run into memory limitations when running some of the 
more demanding unit tests.</p>
