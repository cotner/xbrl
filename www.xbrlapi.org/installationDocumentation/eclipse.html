<h1>Using Eclipse with XBRLAPI</h1>

<h2>Install Eclipse</h2>

<p>Download and install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse version 3.1.2</a>
or later. You can use the normal or the much larger EE version. Extract
it to create, say, the ~/programs/eclipse folder. Open Eclipse and and
set the workspace to, say, the ~/eclipse directory.</p>

<h2>Check out the XBRLAPI project from the Sourceforge Subversion repository.</h2>

<p>
Create a new project by checking it out from the XBRLAPI Sourceforge Subversion repository.
First install Eclipse <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a>.
</p>

<p>
Open the Subversion repository exploring perspective in Eclipse via the windows/perspectives menu.
</p>

<p>
Set up the Subversion repository in Eclipse using URL: <code>https://xbrlapi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xbrlapi</code>
</p>

<p>
Open the XBRLAPI subversion repository to show the branches, tags trunk and www.xbrlapi.org folders.
</p>

<p>
Select the trunk and choose check-out from the context menu to check it out as a project in Eclipse.
That should set up the project more or less correctly.
</p>


<p>In the "Java build path" project properties, add two libraries,
one for the Java runtime library (if it is not there already) and one
for the XBRLAPI project. (Use: ALT-ENTER =&gt; Java Build Path -&gt; Add
Library -&gt; User Library) The one for the XBRLAPI project should contain
all of the JAR files in the java/lib directory that is contained in the
XBRLAPI project directory. This will ensure that the necessary third
party JAR files are also on the class path.</p>

<h2>Enable unit testing from Eclipse</h2>

<p>Specify the location of the test configuration file. Under
Windows-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;Installed JREs, for the JRE that you use for
unit testing, edit the configuration and add the following parameter to
the set of default virtual machine (VM) arguments:</p>

<p><code>-Dxbrlapi.test.configuration=/home/geoff/eclipse/xbrlapi/test.configuration.properties</code></p>

<p>You should now be able to run the full set of tests in the suite provided by
<code>org.xbrlapi.tests.AllTests</code>. This can be run by finding that
source file in the package explorer, right mouse clicking on it to
access the context menu, and then choosing to run the file as a JUnit test.</p>

<h2>Set up specific run jobs to test the basics of the XBRLAPI installation.</h2>

<h3>DOM data store creation, population and usage to build an XML
representation of a DTS</h3>

<p>Create a run job called "XBRLAPI DOM data store Compose operation"</p>
<p>The job is for the xbrlapi project and the main class is org.xbrlapi.Run</p>
<p>The program arguments (on *NIX) are:</p>
<code>
-class org.xbrlapi.data.dom.Compose<br/>
-logger /home/username/eclipse/xbrlapi/conf/log4j.xml<br/>
-cache /home/username/taxonomy_cache<br/>
-output /home/username/dts.xml<br/>
URL<br/>
</code>
<p>Note that this requires you to create a directory for the taxonomy cache at ~/taxonomy_cache</p>
<p>Note also that this requires you to specify the necessary URL to use as a starting point for 
the discovery process in place of "URL".</p>

<p>The virtual machine arguments are: <code>-Xmx1g</code> to ensure that you have adequate memory allocated.</p>

<p>All other settings for the run job should be set to their default values.</p>
