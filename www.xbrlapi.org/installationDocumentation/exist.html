<h1>eXist data store configuration</h1>

<p>This page is relevant to those looking to use the XBRLAPI with the
eXist data store. It provides very terse suggestions on the steps
required to get the eXist database running in a manner that will permit
interaction from the XBRLAPI.</p>

<p>eXist can be configured to support the XBRLAPI as either a separate
Java web application or as an embedded database. Performance is
significantly improved if you used the embedded approach.</p>

<p>You will need to download or otherwise have the xbrlapi-exist module on the
class path to use the eXist data store.</p>

<h2>Setting eXist up as an embedded database</h2>

<p>First follow <a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net/deployment.html#N1042E">
the instructions provided by eXist</a> to get the database set up in embedded mode.
</p>

<p>Second, realise that you also have to copy the catalog.xml file and
the entities directory from the same location that you got your copy of
exist.conf (I get mine from the WEBINF directory of the exist WAR file
installation) and put them into the same directory that you saved your
copy of conf.xml.</p>

<p>Third, realise that the URI of the embedded database needs to be
xmldb:exist:///db so make sure that the eXist database connection is
instantiated using the empty string for both the host and the connection
port. Also, set the path to the database to "db". That should be
sufficient to ensure that the embedded version of eXist is used.</p>

<h2>Setting eXist up within a Java Servlet Container</h2>

<p><a href="java.html">Install a Java SDK</a></p>

<p>Install <a href="jetty.html">Tomcat</a> or <a href="jetty.html">Jetty</a>.</p>

<p>Install the Exist database as a web application in the servlet
container. Download the most recent version of <a href="http://exist.sourceforge.net/">eXist</a>, 
which provides the necessary exist-XXX.war file.  Note that the war file 
name may have components that reflect the version of Exist that you have downloaded.</p>

<p>Rename the war file that you downloaded to exist.war</p>

<p>Move the exist.war file to the webapps directory in your Java servlet container.</p>

<p>Start the servlet container to unpack the exist.war file.</p>

<p>Check that the Exist database is running by entering the URL <a
	href="http://localhost:8080/exist/">http://localhost:8080/exist/</a>.
You may need to change the domain and port for this URL depending on the
configuration of your servlet container. You should see a local homepage
for Exist if you have successfully installed Exist. Check that you can
log in as an administrator using the "admin" userid and a empty string
password "". Browsing the database collections as the administrator will
fail if the file permissions for the database files are set wrongly in
the web application. Check the installation instructions for Exist for
more details on trouble shooting such problems. These files are to be
found in the webapps/exist directory of the Java servlet container in
the default installation configuration.</p>

<p>Once eXist is installed in the Java servlet container, you should be able
to run all of the unit tests in the unit testing suite provided by
<code>org.xbrlapi.data.exist.tests.AllTests</code>. If you run into
problems make sure that the eXist test configuration parameters reflect
your own eXist installation.</p>
