<h1>Installing the Jetty servlet container</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Some of the data store implementations for XBRLAPI are designed to
run within Java servlet containers. Moreover, XBRLAPI itself is suitable
for use by Java servlets and so can motivate a need to have an installed
Java servlet container.</p>

<p>This page gives terse suggestions for setting up the Tomcat servlet
container to host XML database that can act as data stores for XBRLAPI.
More details on Tomcat installation and configuration are available from
the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/index.html">Tomcat 5.5 documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Obtaining and installing Tomcat</h2>

<p>XBRLAPI has been tested with XML databases running from within both
Tomcat and Jetty. This document covers Tomcat 5.5.</p>

<h2>Install Tomcat in the user's home directory for use by a single user</h2>

<p>Note that Tomcat can be installed in other ways, depending on how you
want to use it. If you are doing development work, then having Tomcat
installed for the user that is doing the development work can make the
development process easier, for example, by supporting debugging from
within IDEs.</p>
  
<p>Tomcat 5.5 can be downloaded (get the binary core download) from 
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">tomcat.apache.org</a>.
The XBRLAPI has been tested with Tomcat 5.5.<p>Download <a href="">Tomcat</a>.</p>

<p>Extract the archive file that you downloaded to a folder in the
user's home directory, such as (on Linux) <code>/home/username/programs/</code> to
create <code>/home/username/programs/tomcat</code> or some such.</p>

<h2>Configure Tomcat for use by the single user</h2>

<p>Consider changing the ports specified in the <code>server.xml</code>
configuration file to ensure that the ports for the single user version
of Tomcat does not collide with the ports being used by other servlet
container installations that are also being run.</p>

<h2>Set the environment variables for JAVA_HOME and CATALINA_HOME</h2>

<p>The environment variable, JAVA_HOME, should be set equal to the root
directory of the JAVA SDK installation that you want to use to run
Tomcat. For example: <code>/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun</code>.</p>

<p>The environment variable, CATALINA_HOME, should be set equal to the
root directory of the Tomcat installation that you want to use. For
example: <code>/home/username/programs/tomcat</code></p>
  
<h2>Testing the installation</h2>

<p>Change to the CATALINA_HOME/bin directory and make sure that the
permissions of the shell scripts allow them to be executed by the user
that will be running Tomcat.</p>


<p>Start Tomcat with startup shell script (<code>.s/startup.sh</code> on
*NIX) and stop Tomcat with the stop shell script (<code>./shutdown.sh</code>
on *NIX) once the permissions have been set correctly.</p>


<p>Test if Tomcat is running correctly by opening a web browser to 
<a href="http://localhost:8280/">the Tomcat home page</a> assuming that 8280 
is the port that you specified when you modified the <code>server.xml</code> 
configuration file.</p>
