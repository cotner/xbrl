<h1>Xindice data store configuration</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This page is relevant to those looking to use the XBRLAPI with the
Xindice data store. It provides very terse suggestions on the steps
required to get the Xindice database running in a manner that will permit
interaction from the XBRLAPI.</p>

<p>You will need to download or otherwise have the xbrlapi-xindice module on the
class path to use the Xindice data store.</p>


<p><a href="java.html">Install a Java SDK</a></p>

<p>Install <a href="jetty.html">Tomcat</a> or <a href="jetty.html">Jetty</a>.</p>

<p>Install the Xindice database as a web application in the servlet container.  
Download the most recent stable version of 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/">Xindice</a>. Make sure that you
download the binary webapp. version of Xindice, which provides the
necessary xindice-XXX.war file. Note that the XXX part of the war file
name is likely to differ between releases of Xindice.</p>

<p>Rename the war file that you downloaded to xindice.war</p>

<p>Move the xindice.war file to the webapps directory in your Java
servlet container.</p>

<p>Start the servlet container to unpack the war.</p>

<p>Check that the Xindice database is running by entering the URL 
<a href="http://localhost:8080/xindice/">http://localhost:8080/xindice/</a>.
You should see the ugly debugging tool if Xindice is operating properly.
You may have to change the port number and the domain to match the
servlet container configuration.</p>

<p>Once Xindice is installed in the Java servlet container, you should be able
to run all of the unit tests in the unit testing suite provided by
<code>org.xbrlapi.data.xindice.tests.AllTests</code>. If you run into
problems make sure that the Xindice test configuration parameters
reflect your own Xindice installation.</p>
