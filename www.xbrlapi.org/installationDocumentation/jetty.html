<h1>Installing the Jetty servlet container</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>
Some of the data store implementations for XBRLAPI are designed to
run within Java servlet containers.  Moreover, XBRLAPI itself is suitable 
for use by Java servlets and so can motivate a need to have an installed 
Java servlet container.
</p>

<p>
This page gives terse suggestions for setting up the Jetty servlet 
container to host XML database that can act as data stores for XBRLAPI.
More details on Jetty installation and configuration are available from
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Downloading+and+Installing">Jetty documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Obtaining and installing Jetty</h2>

<p>XBRLAPI has been tested with XML databases running from within both
Tomcat and Jetty. This document covers Jetty which can be downloaded
from <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org">jetty.mortbay.org</a>.  Go to the download page
and get the zip file that contains the latest version of Jetty.
</p>

<p>Unpack the zip file into the location that you want Jetty to be
installed. Generally, at this point Jetty will be installed and running
from http://localhost:8080/. Open that URL (or another if you have
configured Jetty to use a different port or domain name) to see if it
worked. If it failed, follow the Jetty configuration instructions that
are available on the Jetty website.</p>
