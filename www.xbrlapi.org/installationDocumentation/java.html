Configuring the Java environment.
</h1>

<h2>Obtain Java</h2>

<p>XBRLAPI is implemented in Java and requires a Java 1.5 (or
higher) runtime engine to execute. If you intend to use a data store
that is run from within a Java servlet container such as Tomcat or
Jetty, you must install a full Java SDK rather than just a Java runtime
engine. XBRLAPI is being developed and tested using the Linux version of
the <a href="https://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java
1.5 SDK from Sun</a>.</p>

<h2>Install Java</h2>

<p>Follow the necessary instructions for your operating system and your
chosen Java SDK to install the Java SDK. In particular, ensure that you
have set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the directory
containing the Java installation.</p>
