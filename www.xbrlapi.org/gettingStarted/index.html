<h1>
XBRLAPI installation and configuration
</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>This page is relevant to those looking to use XBRLAPI in
their own environment. XBRLAPI can appear daunting but the first steps 
are not difficult and most of the challenges relate to getting the 
underlying data stores that XBRLAPI relies upon up and running.</p>

<p>Many of the suggestions put forward in this document only cover one
way of achieving the desired result, an operational XBRLAPI
installation. Please follow the suggestions at your own discretion. None
of the contributors to XBRLAPI accept responsibility for adverse results
of any kind caused by following these suggestions or using the XBRLAPI.
</p>

<p>For those looking for examples showing how to exercise the API provided by
XBRLAPI, the best place to look is in the examples module where a very simple
data loading example is provided and where a more detailed and realistic
XBRL instance rendering example is also provided.  You can also investigate the unit-testing code.  This is distributed
in the source code archive available as a file release from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=135539">Sourceforge.</a>

<h2>JAR file-naming conventions</h2>

<p>All XBRLAPI modules are released as compiled binaries in the form of JAR files.
Each JAR file has a name that identifies the module and the date on which it was 
generated.  The source code for each module is also made available for download in
a ZIP archive.  ZIP archives follow an identical naming convention to the JAR files.</p>

<h2>Modularisation</h2>

<p>The XBRLAPI is now configured in a modular fashion to minimise the number
of third party JAR dependencies for a particular installation.  Thus, if you are
setting up the XBRLAPI to use the in memory XML DOM representation of the data
store, then you do not have to install the JAR files for the eXist, or
the Oracle Berkeley Database XML data stores.  This considerably simplifies setup 
and limits the potential for conflicts between the JAR files required as dependencies
by different data store implementations.</p>

<p>Modularisation has also split out the code for the handling
of the XML Base, the XML Pointer and the XLink specifications.  The modules for
these specifications will always need to be installed, along with the core XBRLAPI
module and the XBRLAPI utilities module if you are intending to using XBRLAPI.  They have been
split out to ensure that those with an interest in their functionality alone can avoid the rest
of the XBRLAPI.</p>

The modules and their dependencies are as follows:
