<h1>
Requirements for the Java Implementation Plan for the XBRLAPI.ORG XBRL API
</h1>

<h2>Data representation requirements</h2>

<p>The following requirements impact directly upon the data
representation choices for the Java implementation of the XBRL
API:</p>

<ul>

<li>It must be possible to use multiple data representations for the
information in an XBRL DTS without needing to alter the code
implementing the XBRL API.  Rather the XBRL API MUST be implemented in
terms of a series of operations applied to an abstraction of the
underlying data.  This abstraction layer means that each data
representation that can underpin the XBRL API implementation only
needs to provide an implementation of the functions defined in the
abstraction layer.</li>

<li>The XBRL data underlying the XBRL API
implementation MUST contain a superset of the information in the
original XML documents that they are formed from.  In particular, they
MUST preserve enough information to reconstitute the original
XML documents with full accuracy in terms of structures like XML
comments, processor instructions, spacing etc.  The notable exception to this 
requirement is that document type declarations do not need to be recoverable
from the data store.  See 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1788613&group_id=135539&atid=733278">the DTD related bug</a>
for more details on this issue.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Handling of XML Standards</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking/">XLink</a> processing
of the original XML documents, MUST be done by an XLink processor that is separable from the
rest of the code base.  This is intended to simplify interchanging the
reference XLink processor implemented as part of XBRLAPI with other commercial and
non-commercial XLink processors, such as the one released by <a
href="http://software.fujitsu.com/en/interstage-xwand/activity/xbrltools/othertools/">
Fujitsu.</a></li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/">XML Base</a>
resolution will be performed by a generic XML Base resolver that fully
conforms to the XBRL Base 1.0 specification.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xptr-framework-20030325/">XPointer</a>
resolution will be performed by a generic XPointer resolver that fully
conforms to the XPointer framework 1.0 specification and xmlns and
element schemes that are W3C recommendations.</li>

<li>XPointer resolution using the element scheme will allow for recognition of
any id attributes or elements that are identified explicitly to the XPointer
resolver or that are identified as being of ID type in a DTD declaration or an
XML Schema declaration.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Data Discovery</h2>

<ul>

<li>The data discovery process MUST not be memory intensive.</li>

<li>The parser MUST be namespace aware.</li>

<li>The parser must allow for both DTD and XML Schema
validation during the streaming process and it must expose the PSVI 
resulting from XML Schema validation.</li>

<li>The parser must allow for use of a Lexical Handler to ensure
preservation of lexical content in the discovered XML</li>

<li>The parser must allow for use of a Declaration handler to
enable detection of DTD declared ID type attributes (to support
XPointer resolution).</li>

<li>The data discovery process MUST enable all
XML documents that are discovered to be written to a local cache,
making them available on an ongoing basis regardless of changes to
network topology.  A custom entity resolver for the parser must
ensure that the parsing is done on the cached documents rather
than the original documents.</li>

<li>The caching mechanism MUST use the local filesystem to store the
cached documents in a manner that allows intuitive human exploration
of the cache for purposes other than usage of the Java XBRL API
implementation.</li>

<li>The caching of the original XML documents MUST be entirely
separable from the process of decomposing the discovered documents
into meta-data for storage in an XML database.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Validation</h2>

<ul>

<li>The documents loaded into the XBRLAPI data store MUST be validated against
relevant XML-Schema and DTS validation rules.</li>

<li>It must be possible to expose the data in an XBRLAPI data store to a 3rd
party XBRL validation tool to enable the validation functions of that
software to be used.</li>

</ul>
