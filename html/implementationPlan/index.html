<h1>
The Java Implementation Plan for the XBRLAPI.ORG XBRL API
</h1>

<p>
The Java implementation plan is underpinned by the following principles:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
An abstraction layer will be interposed between the functions provided by the 
XBRL API and the actual data that makes up the discoverable taxonomy set data.
This abstraction layer will mean that the data representation used by the 
API implementation can take many different forms.  Each data representation only needs 
to provide an implementation of the functions defined in the abstraction layer.
</li>

<li>
The underlying data storage will rely on an XML Database 
(<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xindice/">Xindice</a> at this stage).
</li>

<li>
The XML database interactions will conform to the 
<a href="http://www.xmldb.org">XML:DB</a> standard to limit the amount 
of code rework required to vary the choice of XML database.
</li>

<li>
The XBRL discoverable taxonomy sets and the XBRL instance documents that 
the XBRLAPI defines functionality against will be represented as fragments 
of XML in the underlying XML database.  Fragmentation of the documents will 
occur at a level that relates to the fragments connected by the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking/">XLink</a> relationships defined in 
the XBRL linkbases.
</li>

<li>
The XLink processing of the original XML documents to form an XBRL discoverable 
taxonomy set will be done by an XLink processor that is entirely separable from 
the rest of the code base.  Ideally, it will be possible to interchange the XLink 
processor used by this application with other commercial and non-commercial XLink 
processors, such as the one released by 
<a href="http://software.fujitsu.com/en/interstage-xwand/activity/xbrltools/othertools/">Fujitsu.</a>
</li>

<li>
The XBRL Discoverable Taxonomy Sets that can be formed by the XBRL API 
implementation will contain a superset of the information in the original XML documents 
that they are formed from.  In particular, they will preserve enough information to 
exactly reconstitute the original XML documents with full accuracy in terms of structures 
like XML comments, processor instructions, spacing etc.
</li>

<li>
The development process will involve using <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> to 
define tests covering all of the API functionality prior to actual implementation. 
</li>

<li>
JUnit testing will following the methodology set out in 
<a href="http://www.manning.com/rainsberger/">"JUnit Recipes" by J.B.Rainsberger</a>.
</li>

<li>
The discoverable-taxononomy-set discovery process will cause all XML documents that are 
discovered to be written to a local cache, making them available on an ongoing basis 
regardless of changes to network topology.  The caching mechanism will use the local 
filesystem to store the cached documents in a manner that allows intuitive human 
exploration of the cache for purposes other than usage of the Java XBRL API 
implementation.  The caching of the original XML documents will be entirely separable 
from the process of decomposing the DTS into meta-data fragments for storage in an XML 
database.
</li>

<li>
It will be possible but not mandatory to perform XML-Schema validation of the documents 
loaded as part of a Discoverable Taxonomy Set.
</li>

<li>
It will be possible but not mandatory to perform XML-Schema validation of modifications to the information contained in a discoverable taxonomy set.
</li>

<li>
It will also be possible to expose a discoverable taxonomy set to a 3rd party XBRL validation tool to enable the validation functions of that software to operate on the DTS.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
More specifics will be supplied here as the planning process continues.
