The homepage for xbrlapi.org
</h1>

<p>
XBRLAPI.ORG is dedicated to the definition and Java implementation of an
opensource XBRL API.  <a href="http://xbrlapi.sourceforge.net">Sourceforge.net</a> kindly provide the project hosting for XBRLAPI.ORG.  The API specification and the Java implementation are released under the GPL license.
</p>

<p>
XBRLAPI.ORG is supported by <a href="http://xbrl.galexy.net/">Galexy</a>.  If your organisation also wishes to support the work programme of XBRLAPI.ORG then please consider contributing expertise and/or time.  Most valuable to XBRLAPI.ORG would be a review of the API specification and contributions of development effort.  Direct funding is not required.
</p>

<p>
The current API specification can be reviewed as a set of <a href="/javadoc/">JavaDocs</a>.  These are currently extremely unstable.
</p>

<p>
The Java <a href="implementationPlan/">implementation strategy</a> is also explained in some detail on this website.  If you have constructive feedback on that strategy it would be most welcome.
</p>

This site is under construction.
