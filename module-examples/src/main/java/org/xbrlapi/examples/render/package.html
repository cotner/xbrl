	<h2>
	What is it?
	</h2>
	
	<p>
	  This is a collection of Java sample applications to demonstrate the usage of 
	  XBRLAPI and its various modules. The Rendering Sample Application loads instance 
	  document using XBRLAPI and renders the document according to XBRL Inline 
	  Specification 0.64. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The the purpose of this project is to give developers step by step instructions
	  to discover a taxonomy set and use Berkeley DB XML API to store the instance 
	  documents and traverse through the various relationship networks to build rendering 
	  solutions. This sample application also demonstrates how to build XBRL Inline 
	  documents using XBRL API.
