<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The aspects package provides comprehensive support of OLAP
interactions with XBRL data. Each XBRL fact has a range of
characteristics. These characteristics are referred to as aspects.
Aspects include but are not limited to, the concept (element) that is
used to report values for the fact, the date or date range that the fact
reports a value for; and the units of measurement - for numeric facts.</p>

<p>However, aspects are only limited by the imagination of users.
For example, an aspect might be the first letter of the reporting
concept's standard english label. Another aspect might be the extended
link role of the presentation network that includes the reporting
concept as a node. For this reason, aspects are extensible such that new
aspects to be defined, as required, to extend the range of OLAP
structures that can be used to analyse XBRL data.</p>

<p>To define a new aspect, you must provide the {@link:Aspect aspect
implementation} and the associated {@link:AspectValue aspect value
implementation}.  You also need to define an aspect value domain to define
the heirarchical ordering of aspect values within the domain.</p>

<p>Aspects can be organised into groups and this is done by defining
{@link:AspectModel aspect models}.</p>

<p>A {@link:Domain domain} is a collection of {@link:AspectValue
aspect values} for a given aspect.</p>

<p>{@link:Cube Cubes} are a combination of an aspect model, that
defines the dimensions of the cube, a domain for each aspect, and a set
of facts, each of which may map to a point defined by the aspect value
space. Cubes keep track of which aspect value, if any, in each domain
each fact maps to. This information can be cached for performance
purposes.</p>

<p>The caching of aspect values and all the various information
about labels etc by locale/role choice etc is separable from the
implementation of aspects so that you can swap in and out various
caching strategies to achieve the desired point in the
complexity/performance tradeoff. The caching system works through the
{@link:AspectCache aspect cache interface}.</p>
