	The aspects package provides some basic support of an OLAP view of XBRL data.
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>
	
    <p>
    This package contains interfaces and implementations 
    of AspectModels, Aspects and AspectValues and 
    AspectValueTransformers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aspect models are a collation of aspects, each one of which provides a piece of
      information about an XBRL fact (eg the concept, the reporting entity, the reporting
      period etc.).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Aspects can be organised into heirarchies within groups 
      (referred to as dimensions). This can be useful in working with aspects to populate 
      rows and columns etc of tabular data arrangments.  Dimensions can have any name.
      Dimensions are an ordered list of aspects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Aspects have a set of aspect values.  Each value can be transformed, according to the 
      rules chosen by the aspect configuration, into a string representation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Aspect models provide a means of getting the set of facts in the aspect model that
      are reported with specified values for a chosen set of aspects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Aspect models can be customised, by using custom transformers for aspects or by
      designing a custom aspect model with custom aspects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The caching of aspect values and all the various information about labels etc
      by locale/role choice etc is separable from the implementation of aspects so that 
      you can swap in and out various caching strategies to achieve the desired point in the 
      complexity/performance tradeoff.
