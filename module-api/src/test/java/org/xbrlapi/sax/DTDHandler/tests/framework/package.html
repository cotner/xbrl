	Tests the features of the DTD handler used by the SAX parser to build a DTD in a DOM object.
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>
	
    <p>This package tests how to use the DTD handler to build a DTD in a DOM object.</p>
    
    <p>
    Right now the conclusion is that it is TOO HARD to create a DOM docType from SAX events
    to insert into the root fragment of a document with a DTD.  This means that document type 
    information, including entities, will be missing from the fragments stored in the data store.
