	Tests the XLink processor and handler.
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>
	
    <p>This package tests the functionality of the XLink processor.</p>

    <p>
	Testing is done using a set of specific XLink handlers and
	a range of simple XLink XML structures hardcoded as strings
	in the tests themselves.
    </p>
    
    <p>
	Testing is used to demonstrate that:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>only true XLink elements are recognised</li>
    <li>custom links are recognised</li>
    <li>XLink attributes are correctly passed to handlers</li>
    </ul>
