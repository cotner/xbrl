Release details:

The XBRLAPI examples module.

Release 5.0
July 31, 2009
Backward incompatible release of the API involving fundamental
changes to the query language.  The query language is now
XQuery 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.  This change has meant
that the Xindice data store is no longer supported.
The new release also provides mature relationship
persistence features, enabling XLink relationships
to be documented in the persisted database to 
dramatically improve the performance of operations
relying on the analysis of XLink relationship networks.
A number of significant changes have also been made to
function signatures in the API, reflecting the fact that
data stores now contain considerably more information
than just fragments of XBRL documents.

Release 4.0
January 7, 2009
Backward incompatible release of the API involving changes
to many method signatures - almost all of which are related
to the decision to replace java.net.URL with java.net.URI where
possible.

Release 3.4
December 10, 2008
Fixed problems in construction of JAR files with the 3.3 release.

Release 3.3
November 24, 2008
First release of this module that provides 
basic examples of how to use the API.
