Release 2.0
March 23, 2006
Created the eXist module by splitting 
it out from the xbrlapi. This limits 
XBRLAPI dependencies on eXist to those 
users choosing to use eXist as the data 
store implementation.

Release 1.0 was the version of the eXist 
data store that was bundled with the XBRLAPI.
