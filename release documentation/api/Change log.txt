6 Aug. 2008
Removed the element depth from the set of 
state information tracked by the SAX content
handler for the loader, the loader itself and
the XBRL XLink handler.  This was done by relying
instead on tracking the ElementState during SAX
parsing.

30 Jul. 2008
Fixed bug in queries to get network roots.
Fixed bug in caching on Windows.
Removed non-functional set methods
Released version 3.1

10 Apr. 2008
Added resource matcher facility.

12 Mar. 2008
Changed the fragment index generation system.  This makes it 
easier to work across several data stores.

25 Feb. 2008
Discovery of documents provided as a string now works correctly.
QName lookups for fragments is faster and always works.
Network construction works for networks of various types of labels.

25. Oct. 2007
Fixed up a bug in Arc instantiation that was preventing
them from being stored in the database.  The bug was
introduced during the redesign of the fragment constructors.

24 Oct. 2007
Added the getFacts method to the concept implementation.
Added the isNumeric method to the fact implementation.

16 Oct. 2007
Modified the fragment factory to call the setFragmentIndex method
when generating new fragments.

17 Sep. 2007
Modified fragment implementations to make all fragments JavaBeans.
Serialization of fragments, builders, and stores is yet to be implemented.

5 Sep. 2007

Eliminated non-working attempts to insert DTD declarations into data store fragments.

Added a new getDeclaration method for reference part fragments.

Fixed a bug in the removeFragment implementation for the DOM data store whereby the
removed fragments were not getting taken out of the XML DOM structure, only the maps onto
that DOM structure.

Added the deleteDocument and deleteRelated document methods to the store interface.  Provided
implementations of these methods in the BaseStoreImpl class.  Created tests of the methods using 
the DOM data store.

4 Sep. 2007

Added BDB XML indexing of the arcroleType and roleType URI attributes.

Added ability to recognise generic labels and references as 
standard labels and references, respectively.

Added the isProhibited method to arcs.

1 Sep. 2007

Added a method to get linkroles that contain arcs using a specified arcrole.

15 Aug. 2007

Added getSimpleLinks method to the fragment interface to get the child simple links of any fragment.

Checked unit tests against the latest cut of the XBRL 2.1 conformance suite.

Enabled caching for documents provided to a loader as a string rather than a URL.
This fixed a bug in the XML Schema grammar construction for schemas provided as a
string to the loader.

Fixed a database deletion problem in the Xindice tests that arose because of 
multiple simultaneous stores using the same database.

Provided a new getChildFragments method of the data store to enable retrieval of all
child fragments with a given data type.

14 Aug. 2007

Enabled the discovery processes to optionally include analysis of XSI schema 
location attributes.

Added schema method to enable discovery of extended links contained within the schema.

11 Aug 2007

Added new discoverNext method to the loader implementation to enable intervention 
in the load process between each document that gets parsed.

Added unit tests of the discoverNext method using in-memory and persistent data stores.

9 August, 2007

Added unit tests to cover discovery of reference part declarations.

8 Aug. 2007

Fixed bug in the SimpleLink#getTargetFragment where href attributes without an XPointer
 would generate a query that did not restrict matching fragments to the document root.

Extended the set of nodes in a data store that are indexed for equality matching for the 
BDB XML database implementation.

Added getImports and getIncludes methods to the Schema fragment API.

Added unit tests to cover schema imports.

July 29, 2007
Added new objects to provide functionality at the level
of individual relationships and networks of relationships.

May 21, 2007
Fixed up omission of class files from the JAR file.

March 23, 2007
Created the api module by splitting 
out the non-DOM data store implementations
and by splitting out the XLink, XMLBase and
XPointer packages.
