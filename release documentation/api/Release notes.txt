Release details:
This package provides the core functionality 
of the XBRLAPI.  The XLink, XPointer,
XMLBase packages also need to be downloaded to 
use the XBRLAPI. The DOM-based data store 
is included.  If you want to use a persistent 
data store then you need to download the JAR 
for the desired data store also.

Release 5.0
July 31, 2009
Backward incompatible release of the API involving fundamental
changes to the query language.  The query language is now
XQuery 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.  This change has meant
that the Xindice data store is no longer supported.
The new release also provides mature relationship
persistence features, enabling XLink relationships
to be documented in the persisted database to 
dramatically improve the performance of operations
relying on the analysis of XLink relationship networks.
A number of significant changes have also been made to
function signatures in the API, reflecting the fact that
data stores now contain considerably more information
than just fragments of XBRL documents.

Release 4.0
January 7, 2009

possible.
