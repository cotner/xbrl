Release details:

The XBRL Dimensions (XDT) implementation.

Release 5.0
July 31, 2009
Made the main classes serializable.
Introduced axes in place of dimensions in aspect models to avoid
clashes with XDT dimensions.  This causes backward incompatibility of
the API but eliminates bugs in the dimension aspect implementations.

Release 4.0
January 7, 2009
Backward incompatible release of the API involving changes
to many method signatures - almost all of which are related
to the decision to replace java.net.URL with java.net.URI where
possible.

Release 3.4
December 10, 2008
Fixed problems in construction of JAR files with the 3.3 release.
Added in new aspects to support the XDT specification and defined
a new dimensional aspect model.

Release 3.3
November 24, 2008
Basic new XDT fragment types created.
XDT fragment detection implemented.
Basic dimension value analysis features implemented.
