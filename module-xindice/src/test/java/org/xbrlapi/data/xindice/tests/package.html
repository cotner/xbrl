	Tests the Xindice data management implementation.
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>
	
    <p>This package tests the functionality of the Xindice database
    interaction classes.</p>

    <p>
    The XBRLAPI implementation requires the following behaviours 
    to be made available to the implementation classes responsible
    for manipulating XBRL DTS fragments.
    </p>
    
    <p>DTS-level behaviours:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to specify, for a DTS, the Xindice database URL
      and the collection being used to store the DTS fragments.</li>
      <li>Ability to create the collection for a DTS if it does not
      already exist</li>
      <li>Ability to delete the collection for a DTS if the DTS is 
      being permanently deleted</li>
      <li>Ability to rename the collection used to store a DTS</li>
      <li>Ability to change metadata about a DTS in the collection 
      metadata including:
        <ul>
          <li>The set of starting point URLs for the DTS discovery</li>
          <li>The timestamp for beginning DTS discovery</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Ability to decompose a DTS into a set of manageable fragments,
      each of which has its own unique identifier, used as the XML fragment 
      id in the DTS database collection</li>
      <li>Ability to marshall the fragments that make up the DTS into a single
      XML DOM object that reflects an augmented set of the DOM objects that
      represent the original XML documents that the DTS was compiled from.</li>
      <li>Ability to marshall the fragments that make up the DTS into a set of 
      XML documents that would be the XML documents required to publish the
      DTS as a valid set of XBRL 2.1 schemas, linkbases and instances.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fragment-level behaviours:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to retrieve a fragment of the DTS given its unique id</li>
      <li>Ability to delete a fragment of the DTS given its unique id</li>
      <li>Ability to DB Update a fragment of the DTS given its unique id and the XUpdate declaration</li>
      <li>Ability to XPath query a fragment of the DTS given its unique id and the XPath query</li>
      <li>Ability to identify the parent fragment of the fragment in a single DOM representation of the DTS</li>
      <li>Ability to identify the node of the parent fragment that contains this fragment
      <li>Ability to identify the number of preceding sibling DOM nodes of this fragment in the containing node
      of the containing fragment</li>
    </ul>
