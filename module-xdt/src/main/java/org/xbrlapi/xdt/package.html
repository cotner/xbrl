  <title>XBRLAPI XDT dimensions support.</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

	Supports the XDT specification for dimensions.
	
	<p>
	This package provides support for features of the XDT specification.
	Note that this implementation makes no claims of completeness or 
	consistency with the specification itself.
  </p>
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>

  <p>
    The XBRL dimensions specification is poorly designed.
    For this reason, the XBRLAPI implementation is designed to be 
    fully separable from the core API.  Hopefully the XBRL dimensions
    specification will be superceded by a more adequate specification
    in the near future.
