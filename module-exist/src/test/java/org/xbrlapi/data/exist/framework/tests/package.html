	Tests the Exist installation to ensure that it is operating as expected.
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>
	
  <p>This package tests the functionality of the Exist installation.</p>
    
  <p><b>In the event that content retrievals from XMLResources obtained 
  from the eXist database are full of corrupt data such as question marks 
  then make absolutely sure that the xmlrpc and the xmldb jars in the eXist 
  web application and in the installation of the xbrlapi are identical.  A mismatch
  can cause serious messes in the way that the information is pulled out of the
  eXist database.</b></p>
